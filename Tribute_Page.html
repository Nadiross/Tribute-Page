            <p class="time-line-title">Here's a time line of Dr. Borlaug's life:
            </p>
            <ul id="time-line">
                <li>
                    <span class="bold">1914</span> - Born in Cresco, Iowa
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="bold">1933</span> - Leaves his family's farm to attend the University of Minnesota, thanks to a Depression era program known as the "National Youth Administration"
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="bold">1935</span> - Has to stop school and save up more money. Works in the Civilian Conservation Corps, helping starving Americans. "I saw how food changed them", he said. "All of this left scars on me."
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="bold">1942</span> - Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="bold">1953</span> - c!rosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a high-yeidling American breed, creating a strain that responds well to fertilizer. It goes on to provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="bold">2005</span> - states "we will have to double the world food supply by 2050." Argues that genetically modified crops are the only way we can meet the demand, as we run out of arable land. Says that GM crops are not inherently dangerous because "we've been genetically modifying plants and animals for a long time. Long before we called it science, people were selecting the best breeds."
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="bold">2009</span> - dies at the age of 95.
